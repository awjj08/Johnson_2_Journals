What do you see?
I see different files or packages for download
Copy and paste 3 names that sound intersting
kismet-plugins - wireless sniffer and monitor - plugins
netsniff-ng - Linux network packet sniffer toolkit
torchat - decentralized instant messenger built on top of the Tor Network
Execute the command: cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
What do you think it means?
the value of the file ip_forward is 0
Why might someone change the value to 1?

You should now install Zenmap
What command(s) are needed to update and install zenmap?
apt-get install Zenmap
Start zenmap

root does not have permission to run graphics; you'll need to use xhost + from your normal VM user.

In a terminal type: nmap --top-ports 25 10.4.27.YOURNINJA+1
What do you see?
The command failed to resolve the location, no targets were specified so 0 hosts were scanned.
Change the 25 to 10 and then to 100 - what changed?

Enter the code: nmap -F 10.4.27.1-29

What did you see?
Nmap scan report for 10.4.27.1(-27)
Host is up (0.013s latency).
Not shown: 98 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE
22/tcp  open  ssh
111/tcp open  rpcbind
(and the corresponding data for the specific scan)
How might this be useful in a digital forensics investigation?
It shows the data for a certain place and all of the things that it went through
Scan the subnet to identify the various OSes

What is an OS?
Operating System
Why would you scan the network for different OSes?
To find out the 
-o is used for OS scans
What command did you use to scan d22 for different OSes?
What is the address of the printer?
What is the address of the switch?

Try the code: nmap --iflist
What does it do?
What are the ipv4 addresses?
What are the ipv6 addresses?
Why the difference?

Now fire up Zenmap and take a picture of the network topography
Why would you want a picture of network topography for digital forensics?
