    There was an email on Scenario Day 5, November 20.
    Among whom was the email shared? Why is it important?
    
    A certain user had a "hidden" directory? Who? What incriminating pictures were on it? [Names, access times]
    Some files named 'patent' aren't. Who created the files? When? On which computer?
    Somebody asks about steganography? What is that? who asked? and why? [hypothetically]
    Someone downloaded and installed encryption software. Who? when? where?
    Someone instructed someone else to delete evidence. Who? Whom?
