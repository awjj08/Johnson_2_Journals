At Rackspace, the most important skills noted for achieving employment were problem-solving and active code development.

For example, presenters noted that they would be most likely to hire someone who goes home and spends hours working with Linux and networking.

Does that describe you? Why or why not?
whenever I want to be great at something, I always spend extra hours into the night practicing and bettering myself at the certain topic.
Similarly, presenters noted a demand for employees who were good at independent problem solving. Does that describe you? Why or why not?
I work best when I am alone, because I can trial and error without having to wait for another or have to report to someone
Have you finished your disk image? Why or why not? 
I have not. I was having a lot of difficulty with my computer, and I wasn't able to work at all yesterday
