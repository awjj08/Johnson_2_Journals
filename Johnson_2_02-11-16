How and why might you capture network data for forensic purposes?
The most reliable way to sniff traffic is to use a network tap. A network tap is a “bump-in-the-wire” device designed only to copy traffic passing through it to a monitor port. You typically insert a network tap inline between two nodes in a network, such as between your firewall and your first switch.
You might be able to find different sites that are being used most frequently, or find different locations based on ip address.
