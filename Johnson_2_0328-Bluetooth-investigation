    What are the attacks described in the Browning and Kessler document? [Briefly describe what each does]
Bluebugging: An extraordinarily powerful attack mechanism, bluebugging allows an attacker to take control of a victim's phone using the AT command parser. 
Bluejacking: The sending of unsolicited messages to open Bluetooth devices by sending a vCard with a message in the name field and exploiting the OBEX protocol 
Bluesmack: A Bluetooth analog of the Ping-of-Death denial-of-service attack. This is a buffer overflow attack using L2CAP echo messages 
Bluesnarf and Bluesnarf++: Attacks allowing for the theft of information from a Bluetooth device using the OBEX Push Profile
Helomoto: Helomoto is functionally similar to the Bluebug attack but takes advantage of poor implementations of "trusted device" handling on some phones.
    Then -- after looking at the document here
    Imagine you are an investigator. There is some suspicious traffic on the network.Describe what is happening?
    You determine that the network was compromised via Bluetooth. How did you determine this?
    What do you suspect happened and why?
    How might you prove this? [Describe specific tools and approaches.
    How will you prevent your network in future from bluetooth attacks?
